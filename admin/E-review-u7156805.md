### Comments 


### Best Part of the Code
The code written by Arjun was not only extremely succient and readable, but the boardstate which is displaye is also well designed and works properly. 

Several classes are  utilised and created for each type of building and gameObject. Nice!

Furthermore, he utilisies Java FX very well, demonstrating that he has a sound understanding of the library.

### Further improvements 

I feel that ```hmRoads``` could've been automated instead of hard-coded coordinates. However, this still gets the job done!
